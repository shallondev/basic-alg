/*
    Bubble Sort

    Idea: "bubble" elements of higher order to the end of the array by swapping them, resulting in a sorted array.
    Code:
        Set a swap counter to a nonzero value.
        Repeat until swap counter is 0:
            Set swap counter to 0.
            Select a element starting with furthest left and then going to next element on next repeat.
            Repeat until end of remaining portion of array after selected element:
                if selected element is less than succesive element swap them.
                
    Time Complexity:
    At best: If the array is sorted then we still select a element and iterate of the array comparing to other elements, Symbol: Î©(n).
    At worst: If the array is reversed then we must iterate over the array, partially iterating over the array for each element, Symbol: O(n^2).

    Use cases:
    Pro: The best case is linear which for sorting alogrithms is not bad.
    Con: At worst we are on quadradic time which for large data is very time expensive.
